# Flash Me - Implementation Roadmap

This document tracks the phased implementation of Flash Me, organised into three versioned releases. **Alpha 0.1** covers the core app (authentication through study mode and import/export). **Alpha 0.2** picks up everything deferred from Alpha 0.1 — tag infrastructure, search/filter, comprehensive testing, accessibility, documentation, and deployment prep. **Beta 0.1** covers the content marketplace and long-term platform features.

## Overview

| Block | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Alpha 0.1](#alpha-01--foundation-to-launch) | Phases 1–7: auth, cards, sets, study, import/export, basic polish | Largely complete |
| [Alpha 0.2](#alpha-02--completeness--polish) | Deferred items from Alpha 0.1: tags, search, testing infra, docs, deployment | Planned |
| [Beta 0.1](#beta-01--marketplace--platform) | Marketplace, Lessons, Web Dashboard, sharing | Long-term |

---

## Alpha 0.1 — Foundation to Launch

All seven core phases. Items marked *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)* are not done in this block and are listed again in Alpha 0.2.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish project foundation and user authentication system.

**Priority**: Critical - All other features depend on this.

#### Tasks

**Deliverable**: Complete data layer with working Firestore integration.

---

### Phase 3: Card Templates & Card Management (Weeks 3-5)

**Goal**: Enable users to create card templates and manage individual cards.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 (need data layer)

**Priority**: High - Core data entry functionality.

#### Tasks

##### Phase 3a — Navigation shell + My Cards screen (complete)
- [x] Add `tags: List<String>` to FlashCard model (user-defined labels for search/filter)
- [x] Replace HomeScreen routing with MainScreen (BottomNavigationBar shell)
- [x] Bottom nav: Sets / Cards / Templates / Profile tabs (IndexedStack, mobile-first)
- [x] My Cards screen: card list from userCardsProvider, empty state, search bar stub, tag filter stub
- [x] Templates screen: placeholder (full UI in Phase 3c)
- [x] Remove stale profile-button from HomeScreen AppBar (Profile is now a tab)
- [x] Remove pop-back auth listener from ProfileScreen (main.dart handles it)

##### Phase 3b — Card creation / edit / delete (complete)
- [x] Card creation form: primaryWord, translation, tags, add/remove additional fields
- [x] Support all three field types in the form (reveal, text_input, multiple_choice)
- [x] Card edit screen (same CardFormScreen, pre-populated from existing card)
- [x] Card deletion with confirmation dialog (AppBar delete icon, edit mode only)
- [x] Wire My Cards FAB → create form; card list tap → edit form

##### Phase 3c — Templates (complete)
- [x] TemplateFormScreen: create/edit template (name, description, primaryWordHidden flag)
- [x] Dynamic field builder — same three field types as cards but answer-free
  - Reveal: structure only (answer filled per card)
  - Text input: hint + exact-match toggle (no correct answers)
  - Multiple choice: pre-fillable options list (no correct index)
- [x] TemplatesScreen: live list from userTemplatesProvider, empty state, FAB → create from scratch
- [x] Template edit and delete (with confirmation dialog)
- [x] "Save as Template" overflow menu on CardFormScreen — nulls out answers,
      pre-populates TemplateFormScreen with the card's field structure

##### Phase 3d — Card from template (complete)
- [x] "Use Template" button in Additional Fields section of CardFormScreen
- [x] Bottom sheet template picker listing user's templates
- [x] Applying a template pre-populates fields (config carried over, answers blank)
- [x] Confirmation dialog when replacing existing fields

##### Phase 3e — Workbook Cards

**Goal**: Add a second card type — prompt + structured questions — alongside Flash Cards. See `docs/design.md § Workbook Cards` for the full specification.

**Data layer**
- [x] `WorkbookCard` model: `fromFirestore` / `toFirestore` / `toJson`
- [x] `WorkbookQuestion` sealed class hierarchy: `TextInputQuestion`, `MultipleChoiceQuestion`, `WordOrderQuestion`
- [x] `MultipleChoiceDisplayMode` enum (`list` | `chips`)
- [x] `WorkbookCardRepository` abstract interface + `FirebaseWorkbookCardRepository`
- [x] `workbookCardRepositoryProvider`, `userWorkbookCardsProvider`
- [x] Extend `SetCard` model with `cardType: String` (`'flashcard'` | `'workbook'`); update `FirebaseCardSetRepository` writes to include it (existing docs without the field default to `'flashcard'`)
- [x] `CardSetRepository.watchSetCards` — streams raw `SetCard` join objects with `cardType` for mixed-set session building
- [x] Extend `StudySession` with `cardTypeMap: Map<String, String>`; update session repository reads/writes (absent field defaults to all `'flashcard'`)
- [x] Firestore security rules for `workbookCards/` (owner-only, same pattern as `cards/`)
- [x] Firestore indexes: `workbookCards` by `createdBy + createdAt`; deploy both

**UI — creation / editing**
- [x] `WorkbookCardFormScreen`: prompt text field + ordered question list with add / remove / reorder
- [x] Inline question editors for all three types (expand in-place; no separate screen)
- [x] Word bank editor: chip-add input for individual tiles; correct-order chip builder
- [x] Display-mode toggle (`list` / `chips`) in the multiple choice question editor
- [x] My Cards screen FAB: card-type chooser bottom sheet (Flash Card / Workbook Card)
- [x] Set detail screen: add-card picker shows both flash cards and workbook cards; passes correct `cardType` to `addCardToSet` (Phase 4 set-detail work)

**UI — study**
- [x] Study session screen: read `cardTypeMap` from session; branch to `_WorkbookCardView` vs existing flash card view
- [x] `_WorkbookCardView`: prompt block + all questions revealed on More tap
- [x] Text input and multiple choice question widgets (`_WorkbookTextInputCard`, `_WorkbookMultipleChoiceCard`)
- [x] `_WordOrderCard`: word bank chip row + answer chip row; tap-to-place / tap-to-return; Check + feedback
- [x] Chips display mode for multiple choice questions
- [x] Question result tracking for workbook questions (`{cardId}_{questionId}` pattern)
- [x] Study setup screen: populate `cardTypeMap` via `watchSetCards` when creating a new session

**Firestore / deploy**
- [x] Deploy updated Firestore rules
- [x] Deploy updated Firestore indexes

##### Flash Cards (remaining / deferred)
- [x] Image and audio attachment on Flash Cards — picker UI in CardFormScreen; upload to Firebase Storage on save; replace/clear deletes old file; thumbnail/audio indicator shown in form
- [ ] Add card metadata display (createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Implement field type icons/indicators *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Add field randomization for multiple choice (optional) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Create default/example templates *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Implement bulk card creation via JSON import (Phase 6) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*

**Deliverable**: Full CRUD for templates and cards, with working field types.

---

### Phase 4: Card Sets Management (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal**: Enable users to organize cards into sets and manage membership.

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 (need cards to organize)

**Priority**: High - Core organizational feature.

#### Tasks

##### Phase 4a — My Sets screen + set CRUD (complete)
- [x] Fix Firestore list-rule violations in CardSetRepository (add userId constraint to all setCards queries)
- [x] MySetsScreen: live list from userSetsProvider, empty state, colour accent bar, tags, relative date
- [x] SetFormScreen: create/edit a set (name, description, colour picker, tags)
- [x] Set deletion with confirmation (cleans up all setCards links)
- [x] SetDetailScreen: placeholder showing card count; edit button → SetFormScreen
- [x] Wire MySetsScreen into the main nav shell (replaces HomeScreen placeholder)

##### Phase 4b — Set detail + card membership (complete)
- [x] Full card list in SetDetailScreen (live via cardsInSetProvider)
- [x] Add cards to set — DraggableScrollableSheet picker with multi-select checkboxes; already-in-set cards shown greyed at the bottom
- [x] Remove card from set — swipe-left Dismissible on each card row
- [x] setByIdProvider — keeps AppBar title in sync after editing set metadata
- [x] Update Firestore indexes: setCards composite indexes now include userId (required by ordered queries with the security rule constraint)

##### Phase 4c — Search & filter (deferred, depends on Phase 4d)
- [ ] Search sets by name *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Filter sets by tag (requires global tag system from Phase 4d) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Sort options (by name, last updated, card count) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Search / filter within set detail view *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Search / filter on My Cards screen (search bar is already stubbed) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*

##### Phase 4d — Global Tag System (deferred to Alpha 0.2)

**Rationale for deferral:** Tag infrastructure is a prerequisite for Phase 4c (tag-based filtering) and for the long-term marketplace feature, but does not block Phase 5 (Study Mode). Implementing it after Phase 5 allows Study Mode — the core value proposition — to ship sooner while the tag system is built correctly without time pressure.

**Design summary:** Tags are stored in a global Firestore collection (`tags/{normalizedName}`) shared across all users. The document ID is the normalized form of the tag (lowercase, trimmed, spaces collapsed to hyphens). A `usageCount` field is maintained as tags are added/removed across all content types. The autocomplete widget queries this collection with a prefix filter. Full design in [docs/design.md — Tag System](design.md#tag-system).

###### 4d-1 — Firestore Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Deploy `tags` collection security rules (read: any authed user; create: authed + `usageCount=1` constraint; update: count-only, `displayName`/`createdBy`/`normalizedName` immutable; delete: never)
- [x] Deploy Firestore indexes: `normalizedName ASC` (prefix queries), `usageCount DESC` (popularity), composite `(createdBy, tags[])` on `cards`, composite `(userId, tags[])` on `sets`

###### 4d-2 — Data Layer ✅
- [x] Implement `normalizeTag(String input) → String` utility in `AppHelpers`
- [x] Implement `TagRepository` abstract interface: `upsertTag`, `decrementTag`, `searchTags(prefix)`
- [x] Implement `FirebaseTagRepository`
- [x] Add `tagRepositoryProvider` and `tagSearchProvider.family` to provider layer

###### 4d-3 — Content Lifecycle Hooks ✅
- [x] Card create/edit: diff old vs new tags → upsert added, decrement removed
- [x] Set create/edit: same
- [x] Card delete: decrement all tags on the card
- [x] Set delete: decrement all tags on the set
- [x] Import: upsert every tag on new cards; diff tags on updated cards

###### 4d-4 — TagInputField Widget ✅
- [x] Build shared `TagInputField`: debounced autocomplete (~300ms), chip display, comma-paste, Enter-to-create, `usageCount >= 2` threshold (own tags always shown)
- [x] Replace chip-input on `CardFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [x] Replace chip-input on `SetFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [x] Replace chip-input on `WorkbookCardFormScreen` + add the 4d-3 lifecycle hooks it was missing (folded in for consistency)

###### 4d-5 — Search & Filter (Phase 4c) ✅
- [x] Tag filter on My Cards screen (search bar already stubbed)
- [x] Tag filter on My Sets screen
- [x] Name search on My Cards and My Sets screens
- [x] Sort options (name, last updated, card count) on sets

**Deliverable**: Complete set management with card organization.

---

### Phase 5: Study Mode - The Core Experience (Weeks 6-8)

- [x] Navigation controls: Previous / Next buttons; Know / Don't Know marking
- [x] Progress indicator: "Card X of Y" label + linear progress bar
- [x] Card marking: known/unknown toggles with visual indicator per card
- [x] Boundary checks: disable Previous on first card, Next on last card
- [x] Card session state tracking: record per-card attempts, result, and timestamp
- [x] Auto-save to Firestore after each navigation action (debounced ~1 s to reduce write volume)
- [x] Session pause: write current state and navigate back; session stays in "active" status
- [x] Session resume: restore card sequence, current index, and all per-card state from Firestore

- [ ] Haptic feedback for answer results *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Enter) for desktop *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [ ] Card preloading for smooth performance *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*

**Deliverable**: Fully functional study mode with session tracking and statistics.

---

### Phase 6: Import/Export (Weeks 8-9)

**Goal**: Enable users to bulk-create cards, share sets, and back up their data via JSON + ZIP.

**Dependencies**: Phase 4 (need sets to export), Phase 3 (need cards)

**Priority**: Medium - Important for data portability and bulk card creation.

#### Tasks

##### Phase 6a — Export (complete)
- [x] Implement Firestore export function (retrieve full set + card data)
- [x] Build ZIP archive: write `cards.json` with relative `media/` paths, download media from Firebase Storage
- [x] Add export metadata to `cards.json` (version, exportDate)
- [x] Create export UI (trigger from set detail screen)
- [x] Implement file download / share sheet

##### Phase 6b — Import (account-level) (complete)

- [x] Fix: enforce `primaryWord` uniqueness within a set in the card picker UI
- [x] New Data screen (accessible from profile screen; hosts both Import and Export sections)
- [x] Import file picker (accepts `.zip`; triggers parse + diff immediately on pick)
- [x] ZIP parser supporting both single-set (`set: {}`) and multi-set (`sets: []`) formats
- [x] Validate required fields (primaryWord, translation, field types, content structure)
- [x] Diff engine: match cards by `primaryWord` within the target set; check global library by `[primaryWord, translation]` before creating — matched library cards are linked (not duplicated)
- [x] Import preview dialog:
  - Options: [Delete cards not in import] [Skip card updates] — apply to all sets
  - Per-set sections: matched set name or "New set"; New / From library / Updated / Deleted card counts
  - Expandable lists: New shows primaryWord + translation; From library shows existing card being linked; Updated shows old→new value per changed field + other affected sets; Deleted shown only when delete option is on
  - Deleting whole sets is never part of import (only per-card deletion within a set)
- [x] Firestore batch write: create/update sets + cards + upload media to Firebase Storage
- [ ] Run tag upsert for every imported tag (see Phase 4d) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*
- [x] Success/error summary report

##### Phase 6c — Bulk export (account-level) (complete)
- [x] Bulk export UI on Data screen: set list with checkboxes + select-all

- [ ] Test full round-trip (export → import → verify data integrity) (deferred — requires Firebase emulator setup) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2)*

##### Phase 6d — Template export/import (complete)
- [x] Export includes all user Card Templates and Question Templates as top-level `cardTemplates`/`questionTemplates` arrays in `cards.json` (both single-set and bulk export)
- [x] Templates fetched directly from repositories at export time (not from cached stream state)
- [x] Import analyze: parses templates from JSON root; deduplicates against DB (QT by Import ID then name, CT by name); JSON-defined QTs added to `##templateId` lookup map so cards in the same file can reference them before they exist in Firestore
- [x] Import execute: creates new Question Templates before Card Templates before cards
- [x] Import preview: collapsible Templates section shows new card and question templates (name, type, Import ID) above the per-set diffs
- [x] Import summary: counts card and question templates created
- [x] Template providers invalidated after import so Templates screen reflects new templates immediately

**Deliverable**: Account-level Data screen with bulk import/export; full round-trip for single and multi-set ZIPs covering all field types and media.

---

### Phase 7: Polish, Testing & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)

**Goal**: Refine UX, ensure stability, and optimize performance.

**Dependencies**: All previous phases

**Priority**: High - Ensures quality release.

#### Tasks

##### Phase 7c — Study tab & study modes (complete)
- [x] Add Study tab to bottom nav (centre position: Sets | Cards | Study | Templates | Profile); icon: `Icons.school`
- [x] `StudyScreen` — mode card list: "Study a Set" (enabled), "Study Review" + "Study Mistakes" (disabled, "Soon" badge)
- [x] Set-picker bottom sheet (`DraggableScrollableSheet`) on "Study a Set" tap; shows name, card count, colour accent; tapping a set navigates to `StudySetupScreen`
- [x] Remove Study FAB from `SetDetailScreen`; replace with play-circle AppBar icon as a quick shortcut

##### Phase 7a — Study flow enhancements (complete)
- [x] Three-phase card reveal: tap word → translation fades in with MORE / NEXT buttons; MORE expands full card; mark buttons activate only after MORE
- [x] Rename Know / Don't Know → **Skip / Review** throughout (study screen, summary screen, strings)
- [x] Skip / Review icons: Skip = check-circle (amber), Review = flag (green)
- [x] `users/{uid}/cardMarks/{cardId}` Firestore subcollection — durable cross-session card marks; fire-and-forget upsert preserving original `markedAt`
- [x] Question result tracking — rolling 5-result window (`success` / `fail` / `unseen`, newest-first) stored at `users/{uid}/questionResults/{cardId}_{fieldId}`; tracked for `text_input` and `multiple_choice` fields; `reveal` fields excluded
- [x] `QuestionResultRepository` + `FirebaseQuestionResultRepository`; prefix range query for per-card lookup without a composite index
- [x] Deploy updated Firestore rules for `cardMarks` and `questionResults` subcollections

##### Phase 7b — Language pair on cards and sets (complete)
- [x] Add `nativeLanguage` + `targetLanguage` (ISO 639-1 string, nullable) to `FlashCard` and `CardSet` models, Firestore serialization, and JSON export
- [x] `lib/utils/languages.dart` — curated list of 74 ISO 639-1 languages (`kLanguages`) + `languageName(code)` lookup
- [x] `LanguagePicker` widget — searchable bottom sheet (`DraggableScrollableSheet`) with autofocus search field filtering by name or code; current selection highlighted; "Not set" always pinned at top
- [x] Language pickers added to `CardFormScreen` and `SetFormScreen`
- [x] Default language inheritance: card created inside a set inherits set's language pair; card created in the Cards section inherits from `lastUsedLanguagesProvider` (last card saved this session)
- [x] One-shot admin script (`scripts/seed_languages.js`) to back-fill language fields on existing Firestore documents

##### UI/UX Polish
- [x] Review all screens for visual consistency
- [x] Improve error messages and user feedback
- [x] Add loading states and spinners
- [x] Implement smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Ensure responsive design on all screen sizes *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2 — widescreen layout owned by the Web Dashboard phase; see Beta 0.1)*
- [ ] Test on various device sizes (phones, tablets, desktops) *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2 — tablet/desktop testing blocked on Web Dashboard phase)*

##### Comprehensive Testing
- [x] Unit tests for models (`CardField`, `FlashCard`, `ImportSetDiff`, `ImportAnalysis`) and import service logic (`_parseCard`, `_buildChanges`, `_fieldsChanged`, new-card routing) — 47 tests, all passing
- [ ] Widget/UI tests for all screens *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2 — lower ROI at this stage; revisit once screens stabilise)*
- [ ] Integration tests for core workflows *(→ deferred to Alpha 0.2 — requires Firebase Local Emulator Suite)*

## Alpha 0.2 — Completeness & Polish

Items deferred from Alpha 0.1, grouped by theme. All are prerequisites for a public release or are technically blocked on other work in this block (e.g. Phase 4c requires Phase 4d).

### Known Defects
- [x] Display Skip / Review indication on card revisit — when navigating back to a card already marked in this session, the current mark (skip/review) is not shown on the card
- [ ] "More" button visible on flash cards with no questions — should be hidden (or disabled) when `card.questions` is empty, so only "Next" shows

### Auth & Account
- [ ] Implement account linking logic for multiple auth providers
- [ ] Test both registration flows (local and Google) on all platforms

### Data Layer
- [ ] Create validation logic for all models
- [ ] Test Firestore operations with integration tests (requires Firebase emulator setup)

### Field / Question Model Unification

**Goal:** Replace the separate `CardField` (flash cards) and `WorkbookQuestion` (workbook cards) models with a single unified question model, used by both card types and their templates.

**Decisions:**

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Card types | Kept separate (`flashcard` \| `workbook`); only the question model is unified |
| Base model | WorkbookQuestion subtypes — more capable, adopted as the canonical form |
| `reveal` question type | Deleted entirely — no trackable outcome, fully covered by the Flash Card primary field |
| Template answers | Single hierarchy with nullable answers (`correctAnswers: List<String>?`, `correctIndex: int?`, `correctOrder: List<String>?`); configuration fields (options, wordBank, hint, displayMode) remain non-nullable |
| Session answer tracking | Remove `textInputAnswers`, `multipleChoiceAnswers`, `revealedFields` from `CardSessionData`; all outcome tracking via `questionResults` subcollection (already in use for workbook cards) |
| Identifier | `questionId` (replaces `fieldId`) |
| Label | `prompt` (replaces `name`) |

**Note on `CardSessionData` simplification:** `textInputAnswers`, `multipleChoiceAnswers`, and `revealedFields` are currently write-only — the study screen never reads them back to restore widget state. Removing them has no visible UI impact. Existing Firestore session documents retain these fields but `fromJson` ignores unknown keys; no session migration needed.

#### Step 1 — Unified question model (data layer) ✅
- [x] Rename `WorkbookQuestion` → `CardQuestion`; rename `questionId` field (already correct); rename `prompt` field (already correct on workbook side)
- [x] Make answer fields nullable on all three subtypes to support templates: `correctAnswers: List<String>?`, `correctIndex: int?`, `correctOrder: List<String>?`
- [x] Add `WordOrderQuestion` to the flash card field type set (flash cards can now include word-order questions)
- [x] Remove `CardField`, `CardFieldContent`, `RevealContent`, `TextInputContent`, `MultipleChoiceContent` — replaced by `CardQuestion` subtypes
- [x] Update `FlashCard` model: replace `fields: List<CardField>` with `questions: List<CardQuestion>`
- [x] Update `CardTemplate` model: replace `fields: List<CardField>` with `questions: List<CardQuestion>`
- [x] Update `fromFirestore` / `toFirestore` / `fromJson` / `toJson` on `FlashCard` and `CardTemplate`
- [x] Simplify `CardSessionData`: remove `revealedFields`, `textInputAnswers`, `multipleChoiceAnswers`; update `fromJson`/`toJson`
- [x] Update `FirebaseCardRepository` writes to use `questions` key

#### Step 2 — Firestore data migration ✅
- [x] Migration script: for each doc in `cards/`, rename `fields` → `questions`; within each question rename `fieldId` → `questionId`, `name` → `prompt`; delete any questions with `type == 'reveal'`
- [x] Migration script: for each doc in `templates/`, same field renames and reveal removal
- [x] Deploy and verify; no session migration needed (unknown keys ignored by `fromJson`)

#### Step 3 — Card form UI ✅
- [x] Replace `CardFormScreen` field editors with unified `CardQuestion` editors
- [x] Remove reveal field editor and "Add Reveal Field" option
- [x] Update `TemplateFormScreen` similarly
- [x] Update "Save as Template" flow to null out answer fields on the unified type

#### Step 4 — Study screen ✅
- [x] Replace flash card `_buildField` / `_RevealFieldCard` / `_TextInputFieldCard` / `_MultipleChoiceFieldCard` with unified `_buildQuestion` / workbook question widgets
- [x] Remove `_RevealFieldCard` entirely
- [x] Unified `_recordQuestionResult` covers both flash card and workbook card questions
- [x] Flash card `_PrimaryFieldCard` and two-phase word reveal unchanged

#### Step 5 — Import / export ✅
- [x] Update `ExportService` to serialise `questions` (unified type) instead of `fields`
- [x] `ImportService` handles both old (`fields`) and new (`questions`) ZIP formats
- [x] Import validation updated for unified question types

#### Step 6 — Question templates (new feature, depends on Steps 1–3) ✅
- [x] `QuestionTemplate` Firestore collection (`questionTemplates/{templateId}`): `createdBy`, `name`, `description`, `question: CardQuestion` (single question, answers nullable)
- [x] `QuestionTemplateRepository` + `FirebaseQuestionTemplateRepository`
- [x] `questionTemplateRepositoryProvider`, `userQuestionTemplatesProvider`
- [x] Question template picker in `CardFormScreen` — two-tab bottom sheet (Card Templates / Question Templates); selecting a question template appends without replacing
- [x] "Use Template" button in `TemplateFormScreen` — opens question template picker, appends to template questions
- [x] Create / edit / delete question templates from the Question Templates tab in the Templates screen
- [x] Firestore security rules for `questionTemplates/`
- [x] Optional Import ID (`templateId`) field on `QuestionTemplate` — user-defined slug (alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore), unique per user; validated and checked for uniqueness on save in `QuestionTemplateFormScreen`
- [x] Import shorthand: `{"template": "##id", "correctIndex": N}` — importer resolves `##id` references at parse time, merging template structure with answer-field overrides; unknown references fail immediately with a descriptive error
- [x] `QuestionTemplateRepository.getUserTemplates()` — one-shot future for import-time lookup
- [x] Trailing commas tolerated in hand-authored `cards.json` files
- [x] Fix: `cardsInSetProvider` invalidated after import so updated card data (questions, `correctIndex`) is visible immediately in study mode without requiring a full app restart

### Cards & Templates
- [ ] Add card metadata display (createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy)
- [ ] Implement field type icons/indicators
- [ ] Add field randomization for multiple choice
- [ ] Create default/example templates
- [ ] Bulk card creation via JSON import (keyboard-focused grid UI — see Web Dashboard in Beta 0.1)

### Global Tag System (Phase 4d)

**Design summary:** Tags stored in `tags/{normalizedName}` (global, shared across users). Document ID is the normalized tag. `usageCount` maintained on add/remove. Autocomplete queries with a prefix filter. Full design in [docs/design.md — Tag System](design.md#tag-system).

#### 4d-1 — Firestore Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Deploy `tags` collection security rules (read: any authed user; create: authed + `usageCount=1` constraint; update: count-only, `displayName`/`createdBy`/`normalizedName` immutable; delete: never)
- [x] Deploy Firestore indexes: `normalizedName ASC` (prefix queries), `usageCount DESC` (popularity), composite `(createdBy, tags[])` on `cards`, composite `(userId, tags[])` on `sets`

#### 4d-2 — Data Layer ✅
- [x] Implement `normalizeTag(String input) → String` utility in `AppHelpers`
- [x] Implement `TagRepository` abstract interface: `upsertTag`, `decrementTag`, `searchTags(prefix)`
- [x] Implement `FirebaseTagRepository`
- [x] Add `tagRepositoryProvider` and `tagSearchProvider.family` to provider layer

#### 4d-3 — Content Lifecycle Hooks ✅
- [x] Card create/edit: diff old vs new tags → upsert added, decrement removed
- [x] Set create/edit: same
- [x] Card delete: decrement all tags on the card
- [x] Set delete: decrement all tags on the set
- [x] Import: upsert every tag on new cards; diff tags on updated cards

#### 4d-4 — TagInputField Widget ✅
- [x] Build shared `TagInputField`: debounced autocomplete (~300ms), chip display, comma-paste, Enter-to-create, `usageCount >= 2` threshold (own tags always shown)
- [x] Replace chip-input on `CardFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [x] Replace chip-input on `SetFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [x] Replace chip-input on `WorkbookCardFormScreen` + add the 4d-3 lifecycle hooks it was missing (folded in for consistency)

#### 4d-5 — Search & Filter (Phase 4c) ✅
- [x] Tag filter on My Cards screen (search bar already stubbed)
- [x] Tag filter on My Sets screen
- [x] Name search on My Cards and My Sets screens
- [x] Sort options (name, last updated, card count) on sets

### Marketplace MVP (Phase 8)

**Goal**: Enable creators to offer sets in a public Market; other users can browse and clone them. Subscriptions, moderation, and full search deferred to Beta 0.1.

**Design**: [docs/design.md — Marketplace MVP](design.md#marketplace-mvp)

#### Mk-1 — Firestore Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Update `sets` security rules: allow read for any authenticated user when `isPublic == true`
- [x] Deploy `setAcquisitions` collection rules: any authenticated user may create a record for themselves; reads restricted to involved user IDs
- [x] Deploy Firestore indexes: `sets (isPublic ASC, createdAt DESC)`, `setAcquisitions (originalSetId ASC, acquiredAt DESC)`, `setAcquisitions (acquiredByUserId ASC, acquiredAt DESC)`
- [x] Add `acquisitionCount: int` (default 0) to `CardSet` model and Firestore serialisation

#### Mk-2 — Publish / Unpublish ✅
- [x] "Offer in Market" action on Set detail screen — opens a bottom sheet with publication options
- [x] Initial options: Allow Clone (on by default, not toggleable in this phase — extensible for future types)
- [x] Sets `isPublic = true` on the Firestore document
- [x] "Remove from Market" (un-publish) action with guard: shows `acquisitionCount` before confirming
- [x] Sets `isPublic = false`; does not affect existing acquired copies

#### Mk-3 — Market Tab ✅
- [x] Split Sets section into **My Sets** | **Market** tabs (`DefaultTabController`)
- [x] Market tab: streams all public sets ordered by `createdAt DESC`
- [x] `SetRepository` gains `watchPublicSets()` stream
- [x] `publicSetsProvider` Riverpod provider
- [x] Market tile: set name, description, tags, card count, language pair, creator display name, acquisition count
- [x] Creator display name resolved from `users/{userId}` (one-shot read, cached per tile)

#### Mk-4 — Clone ✅
- [x] Dedicated clone confirmation screen (not a generic dialog — structured to accommodate preview details in future iterations)
- [x] Clone logic:
  - Create new `CardSet` under cloner's `userId` (copies name, description, tags, color, language pair)
  - Flash cards: match existing library card by `[primaryWord, translation]`; link if found, copy if not
  - Workbook cards: always copy (no reliable dedup key yet — see Mk-5)
  - Write `setAcquisitions` record
  - Increment `acquisitionCount` on original set (Firestore `FieldValue.increment(1)`)
- [x] Cloned set appears in the cloner's My Sets tab
- [x] `SetAcquisitionRepository` abstract interface + `FirebaseSetAcquisitionRepository`
- [x] `setAcquisitionRepositoryProvider`

#### Mk-5 — (Fast follow) Card Acquisition Tracking ✅
- [x] Design `cardAcquisitions` collection: universal card dedup key independent of card type or field structure
- [x] `cardAcquisitions` Firestore rules + indexes
- [x] Update clone logic to use `cardAcquisitions` for workbook card dedup and to record card-level provenance
- [x] Abstract over card type so any future card type is supported without bespoke dedup logic

#### Mk-6 — Re-clone / Update Flow ✅
- [x] Detect when user taps a market set they have previously cloned
- [x] Show "You Already Have This Set" screen instead of clone confirmation
- [x] Async diff check: compare source set cards against user's acquisition via `cardAcquisitions` + `updatedAt`
- [x] Updates available: show new/updated counts + "Update My Copy" button (updates in place, no new set)
- [x] Up to date: show confirmation + OK button
- [x] `SetAcquisitionRepository.checkForUpdates()` + `applySetUpdate()` + `setUpdateDiffProvider`
- [x] Removed cards from source are intentionally ignored (clone is independent; full sync is for future subscription feature)

## Beta 0.1 — Marketplace & Platform

These features are important but deferred to post-Alpha-launch:

### Marketplace (full)

> **Alpha 0.2 already delivers publish + browse + clone (Phase 8 above). Beta 0.1 adds the remaining marketplace capabilities.**
> See [docs/design.md — Marketplace & Lessons](design.md#marketplace--lessons--long-term-vision) for the long-term vision.

- **Subscriptions** — user's library includes subscribed sets; receives live updates when owner edits
- **Marketplace Discovery** — search by name/description (requires external full-text search: Algolia, Typesense, or Firebase Search Extension); filter by language, tag, popularity
- **Creator Tools** — subscriber counts, view counts, full acquisition history dashboard
- **Content Moderation** — flagging, takedowns, abuse prevention (required before public launch)
- **Lessons** — a new content type: an ordered grouping of sets forming a structured learning curriculum; own data model, creation UI, and study flow

**Architectural foundations already in place:**
- Global normalized tag system (Alpha 0.2) — tags converge across users for marketplace search
- `isPublic` on `CardSet`, `createdBy` on all content types
- `setAcquisitions` collection (Alpha 0.2) — designed to cover subscriptions from day one (`acquisitionType` field)
- `setCards` join collection supports future subscription patterns

### Sharing & Community
- [ ] Set subscriptions (see Marketplace above)
- [ ] User profiles and profile management
- [ ] Social features (ratings, reviews, followers)

### Advanced Study Features
- [ ] Spaced repetition algorithm
- [ ] Adaptive difficulty
- [ ] Study statistics and learning graphs
- [ ] Recommended study sessions
- [ ] Flashcard mastery levels

### Data Features
- [ ] Quizlet import
- [ ] Bulk export to other formats
- [ ] Cloud backup/restore
- [ ] Automatic scheduled backups

### Mobile-Specific
- [ ] Native notifications for study reminders
- [ ] Home screen widgets (study progress)
- [ ] Shortcuts/voice commands

### Desktop-Specific
- [ ] Keyboard-centric UI modes
- [ ] Window management enhancements
- [ ] Drag-and-drop improvements

### Deferred Animation Work (from Phase 7 polish pass)
- [ ] Staggered list-item entrance animations on Sets, Cards, and Templates screens (first-load fade-in per item)
- [ ] Animated add/remove for dynamic fields in CardFormScreen and TemplateFormScreen (`AnimatedList` refactor)

### Web Dashboard — Bulk Card Creation & Desktop Experience

> **Full design: [docs/design.md — Web Dashboard](design.md#web-dashboard--bulk-card-creation--desktop-experience)**

This phase establishes the desktop layout conventions for the whole app (responsive shell, NavigationDrawer, content max-width) and delivers a keyboard-focused bulk card creation interface for teachers and content creators.

**Why deferred:** Widescreen layout decisions are made here once, correctly, rather than retrofitted during Alpha 0.1 mobile polish.

#### Dashboard Alpha
- [ ] Responsive shell: swap `BottomNavigationBar` → persistent `NavigationDrawer` above a screen-width breakpoint; establish content max-width constraints app-wide
- [ ] Bulk card editor: template-driven grid (one row per card, columns match template fields), keyboard Tab/Enter navigation, batch Firestore write on save
- [ ] Set assignment on save — choose or create target set before committing

#### Dashboard Beta
- [ ] Inline per-cell field validation
- [ ] Undo/redo, duplicate row, reorder rows

#### Master-detail layouts
- [ ] Set detail split-pane (card list + card preview/edit panel)
- [ ] Cards screen list + form panel

#### Advanced creator tools
- [ ] CSV paste with column mapping
- [ ] Bulk tag assignment

---

## Dependencies & Critical Path

**Critical Path** (longest sequence of dependent tasks):
1. Phase 1: Authentication
2. Phase 2: Data models
3. Phase 3: Cards & Templates
4. Phase 4: Card Sets
5. Phase 5: Study Mode (the core value delivery)

**Parallel Work** (can be done while other phases progress):
- Some Phase 6 (Import/Export) can be started once Phase 2-3 are complete
- Phase 7 (Testing) can begin after Phase 5
- Alpha 0.2 Global Tag System unblocks Phase 4c Search & Filter

|------|-----------|
| Firebase integration complexity | Allocate buffer time in Phase 1, thorough testing |
| Performance with large card sets | Profile early, optimize Firestore queries, implement pagination |
| Cross-platform issues | Test on real devices early and often |
| Complex study state management | Consider state management library (Riverpod), test thoroughly |
| User data loss | Implement robust error handling, backup/recovery mechanisms |
| Scope creep | Stick to MVP features, defer "Nice to Have" items |

---
