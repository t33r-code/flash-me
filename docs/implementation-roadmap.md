## Phase 2: Core Data Models & Database Schema (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Establish data structures and backend infrastructure.

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (need authenticated user)

**Priority**: Critical - Foundation for all feature development.

### Tasks
- [x] Create Dart data models for: User, Card, CardField, CardTemplate, CardSet, StudySession
- [x] Design and create Firestore collection structure:
  - [x] `users/{userId}` — user profiles
  - [x] `templates/{templateId}` — card templates
  - [x] `cards/{cardId}` — individual cards
  - [x] `sets/{setId}` — card sets
  - [x] `setCards/{linkId}` — many-to-many join (replaces cardIds[] on sets)
  - [x] `users/{userId}/studySessions/{sessionId}` — study sessions
- [x] Create JSON serialization/deserialization for all models (fromJson, toJson, fromFirestore, toFirestore)
- [x] Set up Firestore indexes:
  - [x] Query by userId + createdAt (templates, cards, sets)
  - [x] Query by setId + addedAt (setCards — for retrieving cards in a set)
  - [x] Query by cardId + addedAt (setCards — for set membership lookup)
  - [x] Query by setId + status + lastAccessTime (study sessions)
- [x] Create data service layer (TemplateService, CardService, CardSetService, StudySessionService)
- [x] Implement Firestore write operations (create, update, delete)
- [x] Implement Firestore read operations (get, list, query)
- [x] Implement batch operations for bulk card operations
- [x] Set up proper error handling and exception types (AppException)
- [x] Wire Riverpod providers for all services and streams
- [ ] Create validation logic for all models (deferred to Phase 3 with UI)

- [x] Card edit screen (same CardFormScreen, pre-populated from existing card)
- [x] Card deletion with confirmation dialog (AppBar delete icon, edit mode only)
- [x] Wire My Cards FAB → create form; card list tap → edit form

#### Phase 3c — Templates (complete)
- [x] TemplateFormScreen: create/edit template (name, description, primaryWordHidden flag)
- [x] Dynamic field builder — same three field types as cards but answer-free
  - Reveal: structure only (answer filled per card)
  - Text input: hint + exact-match toggle (no correct answers)
  - Multiple choice: pre-fillable options list (no correct index)
- [x] TemplatesScreen: live list from userTemplatesProvider, empty state, FAB → create from scratch
- [x] Template edit and delete (with confirmation dialog)
- [x] "Save as Template" overflow menu on CardFormScreen — nulls out answers,
      pre-populates TemplateFormScreen with the card's field structure

#### Phase 3d — Card from template (complete)
- [x] "Use Template" button in Additional Fields section of CardFormScreen
- [x] Bottom sheet template picker listing user's templates
- [x] Applying a template pre-populates fields (config carried over, answers blank)

## Phase 4: Card Sets Management (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal**: Enable users to organize cards into sets and manage membership.

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 (need cards to organize)

**Priority**: High - Core organizational feature.

### Tasks

#### Phase 4a — My Sets screen + set CRUD (complete)
- [x] Fix Firestore list-rule violations in CardSetRepository (add userId constraint to all setCards queries)
- [x] MySetsScreen: live list from userSetsProvider, empty state, colour accent bar, tags, relative date
- [x] SetFormScreen: create/edit a set (name, description, colour picker, tags)
- [x] Set deletion with confirmation (cleans up all setCards links)
- [x] SetDetailScreen: placeholder showing card count; edit button → SetFormScreen
- [x] Wire MySetsScreen into the main nav shell (replaces HomeScreen placeholder)

#### Phase 4b — Set detail + card membership (complete)
- [x] Full card list in SetDetailScreen (live via cardsInSetProvider)
- [x] Add cards to set — DraggableScrollableSheet picker with multi-select checkboxes; already-in-set cards shown greyed at the bottom
- [x] Remove card from set — swipe-left Dismissible on each card row
- [x] setByIdProvider — keeps AppBar title in sync after editing set metadata
- [x] Update Firestore indexes: setCards composite indexes now include userId (required by ordered queries with the security rule constraint)

#### Phase 4c — Search & filter (deferred, depends on Phase 4d)
- [ ] Search sets by name
- [ ] Filter sets by tag (requires global tag system from Phase 4d)
- [ ] Sort options (by name, last updated, card count)
- [ ] Search / filter within set detail view
- [ ] Search / filter on My Cards screen (search bar is already stubbed)

#### Phase 4d — Global Tag System (deferred to after Phase 5)

**Rationale for deferral:** Tag infrastructure is a prerequisite for Phase 4c (tag-based filtering) and for the long-term marketplace feature, but does not block Phase 5 (Study Mode). Implementing it after Phase 5 allows Study Mode — the core value proposition — to ship sooner while the tag system is built correctly without time pressure.

**Design summary:** Tags are stored in a global Firestore collection (`tags/{normalizedName}`) shared across all users. The document ID is the normalized form of the tag (lowercase, trimmed, spaces collapsed to hyphens). A `usageCount` field is maintained as tags are added/removed across all content types. The autocomplete widget queries this collection with a prefix filter. Full design in [docs/design.md — Tag System](design.md#tag-system).

- [ ] Create `tags` Firestore collection; deploy security rules (read: any authed user; create/update: authed user with constraints; delete: never)
- [ ] Add Firestore indexes for prefix queries (`normalizedName ASC`) and array-contains tag filters on `cards` and `sets`
- [ ] Implement `normalizeTag(String input) → String` utility in `AppHelpers`
- [ ] Implement `TagRepository` abstract interface with: `upsertTag`, `decrementTag`, `searchTags(prefix)`
- [ ] Implement `FirebaseTagRepository`
- [ ] Add `tagRepositoryProvider` and `tagSearchProvider.family` to provider layer
- [ ] Build shared `TagInputField` widget: debounced autocomplete, chip display, comma-paste, Enter-to-create
- [ ] Replace current chip-input on `CardFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [ ] Replace current chip-input on `SetFormScreen` with `TagInputField`
- [ ] Update card save/edit to diff old vs new tags and call upsert/decrement accordingly
- [ ] Update set save/edit to diff old vs new tags similarly
- [ ] Update card delete to decrement all tags on the deleted card
- [ ] Update set delete to decrement all tags on the deleted set
- [ ] Update import flow (Phase 6) to run upsert for every imported tag
- [ ] Deploy updated Firestore rules and indexes
- [ ] Wire tag filter into Phase 4c (My Cards and My Sets screens)

**Deliverable**: Complete set management with card organization.

- [x] "Try Again" button to re-attempt a field after a wrong answer
- [x] Feedback messaging (correct, incorrect, partial) with visual distinction

#### Phase 5c — Session controls, navigation & persistence (complete)
- [x] Navigation controls: Previous / Next buttons; Know / Don't Know marking
- [x] Progress indicator: "Card X of Y" label + linear progress bar
- [x] Card marking: known/unknown toggles with visual indicator per card
- [x] Boundary checks: disable Previous on first card, Next on last card
- [x] Card session state tracking: record per-card attempts, result, and timestamp

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

These features are important but can be deferred to post-launch:

### Marketplace & Lessons

> **See [docs/design.md — Marketplace & Lessons](design.md#marketplace--lessons--long-term-vision) for full pre-design notes.**

The long-term vision for Flash Me is a content marketplace where users can publish sets and lessons for others to discover, study, and build upon. Key planned capabilities:

- **Published Sets** — owners mark sets as public; non-owners can browse, subscribe, or clone
- **Lessons** — a new content type: an ordered grouping of sets forming a structured learning curriculum (analogous to a course chapter). Requires its own data model, creation UI, and study flow.
- **Marketplace Discovery** — browse by tag (global tag system), search by name/description (requires external full-text search service: Algolia, Typesense, or Firebase Search Extension), sort by popularity/recency
- **Subscriptions** — user's library includes subscribed sets; receives updates when owner edits
- **Cloning** — user gets an independent editable copy; clone provenance recorded for attribution
- **Creator Tools** — view counts, subscriber counts, clone counts for publishers
- **Content Moderation** — flagging, takedowns, abuse prevention (required before public launch)

**Architectural decisions already made in support of this:**
- Global normalized tag system (Phase 4d) — tags converge across users for marketplace search
- `isPublic` field reserved on `CardSet`
- `createdBy` on all content types for attribution
- `setCards` join collection supports future subscription patterns

**Implementation phasing (future):**
1. Marketplace Alpha — publish/unpublish; tag + popularity browsing; subscribe + clone
2. Marketplace Beta — ratings, reviews, moderation
3. Lessons — data model, creation UI, lesson-level study flow
4. Creator Analytics & optional monetization design

### Sharing & Community
- [ ] Set subscriptions (see Marketplace above)
- [ ] Set cloning (see Marketplace above)
- [ ] User profiles and profile management
- [ ] Social features (ratings, reviews, followers)

### Advanced Study Features
- [ ] Spaced repetition algorithm
- [ ] Adaptive difficulty
- [ ] Study statistics and learning graphs
- [ ] Recommended study sessions
- [ ] Flashcard mastery levels

### Data Features
- [ ] Quizlet import
- [ ] Bulk export to other formats
- [ ] Cloud backup/restore
- [ ] Automatic scheduled backups

### Mobile-Specific
- [ ] Native notifications for study reminders
- [ ] Home screen widgets (study progress)
- [ ] Shortcuts/voice commands

### Desktop-Specific
- [ ] Keyboard-centric UI modes
- [ ] Window management enhancements
- [ ] Drag-and-drop improvements
